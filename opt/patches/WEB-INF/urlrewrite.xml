  <rule>
    <note>
      Forward all requests ending with a slash, but NOT proceded by a url containing 
      a period, to */index.cfm. Winstone handles welcome files using redirects, which 
      is different from jetty which uses forwards. This replaces welcome file handling
      for index.cfm files and makes winstone act more like jetty.
